MuraFuseGuardConnector
======================

The FuseGuard Web Application Firewall for ColdFusion is a set of code designed to run inside your existing CFML web applications to block, filter, or log potentially malicious requests.

Installation is as simple as adding a few lines of code to your Application.cfm or Application.cfc file, and optionally creating a database (see the install.txt file for details). Configuration, and all of the actual filtering, is done with ColdFusion so you don't need to learn a new XML language or complicated user interfaces. The Foundeo WAF (Web Application Firewall) is designed for easy implementation and extension


REQUIRES:
Adobe ColdFusion 9 or 10
